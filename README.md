##Repeater OSM##
osm POI files for US amateur radio repeaters.

##Generating OSM Files from CSVs##
The osm files are best generated by using JOSM. It uses the excess fields as tags which I have yet to figure out how to make gpsbabel do.
Enable the "dataimport" plugin and then open the CSV and save it as an ".osm". Repeat for all CSVs independently.


##Generating OsmAnd Data From OSM Files##
Grab (OsmAndMapCreator)[http://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/]. Unzip and run the ```OsmAndMapCreator.sh``` or ```OsmAndMapCreator.bat``` script. Use the ```create .obf from osm file...``` to select each OSM file and wait for each to convert.
